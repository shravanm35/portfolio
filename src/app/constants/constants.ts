export const COVER_LETTER = `Dear Minal,

This is a letter to express my intrest at the position of UI developer at your organization Neptune Ubicom.
I came across the job and find it relative to the position I am looking for and would like to further grow in the role in your organization. I have done some research and have found that your organization would be a good fit for me as it has a very good working culture and a good work life balance which is like a unicorn these days.

I am passionate about my work and always ready to learn new skills and stay updated with the latest trends and technologies.

I have experience working on client site as well as onsite with highly demanding clients and have gained ability to perform with high efficiency in pressure situations. I had the responsibility to deliver the UI for the Crowned Prince of Abu Dhabi which was going to be used by him, which I was able deliver within the timelines and good code quality for which I have received appreciation from Accenture leadership as well. I have developed complex UIâ€™s and components. I have been the top performer in all the teams I have worked in.

Thanks for considering my application and would surely add much value and experience to the organization in terms of UI development and give my 100%.
I look forward for the other rounds and looking forward to working with you.


Sincerely,
Shravankumar Mane`;
